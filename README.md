# Exercise 6 - State Management

+ Title:  State Management on Flutter

+ Code Description: This code is similar to a management app similar to the example in the module. But this time there is an implementation of a checkout feature.

+ How to use: I added a few different features on the sample run... On the first screen you will see the catalog with the items and there is a cart button at the bottom right to show the current cart. On the cart screen, the added items along with the total cost is shown. There is also a reset and continue button. The reset button will reset the cart. While the checkout button will show the items checkedout along with the item price and the total cost of the item.
